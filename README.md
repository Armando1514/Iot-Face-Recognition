# IotFaceRecognition
FaceRecognition via MQTT and IFTTT.
Let's talk about my idea, we have the need of analyse data from resources like surveillance camera or some camera. It will be userfull for some use cases, for example, recognization about peole that are committing a crime or something similar. The iot project is composed about a client, in  our case a simulator of a "reader from surveillance camera", a simple interface were you upload photo of a person, it detects the face and recognize some charateristicts about the face (for example  age, gender, ethnicity, emotions etc.), maybe this analyses is accomplished in real world by a fog node. After the client sends via MQTT the data of the analysis. When a message arrive on MQTT a function in nuclio is triggered, this function  take the raw data and accomplishes some filter and enrichment of data and in  second moment sends it to  IFTTT webhook, that is triggered and send a message to telegram.
Summary: Analyisis of face, that provides some charateristics of the face like age, gender, emotions, ethnicity etc. on my phone from a iot entity.
